# Begin Where You Are

## Step 1: Awareness. 
+ Wake up. Realize you need to move, become uncomfortable, and seek a way out of the valley.
## Step 2: Discovery. 
+ Find a decent day that leads to a decent life. Remember Aesope's fable about the Tortoise and the Hare? Slow and steady is a key to winning the race. 
## Step 3: Reflection. 
+ Plan-do-check-act. Ready, fire, aim. Try something, check the results, improve your plan and try again.
