Hello, I'm eager to chat about anything you are interested in, or what I'm working on. I enjoy tinkering and learing. I'm curious to a fault. I live to crack the code. The code being what it takes to have a decent life. I'm not worried about a great life - might take too much luck. I'm looking for an approach to a decent life measured by how we treat others.

I'd like my tombstone to read "He led us through the valley.", and I don't want it to be a lie. A valley is as much a feeling as a goegraphy. I believe most people are unaware they are in a valley. Like Thoreaugh said, "lives of quiet desperation".

Step 1: Awareness. Wake up. Realize you need to move, become uncomfortable, and seek a way out of the valley.
Step 2: Discovery. Find a decent day that leads to a decent life. Remember Aesope's fable about the Tortoise and the Hare? Slow and steady is a key to winning the race. 
Step 3: Reflection. Plan-do-check-act. Ready, fire, aim. Try something, check the results, improve your plan and try again.

With a lot of luck and a litle hard work, I've managed to build a blessed life for myself. I'm married to an incredible lady -- and have been for over 25 years. I am a parent to six children, and I get to teach at a wonderful university, Creighton. 

How can you help me? Invite me to speak on goal planning (the daily routine). 
I also enjoy teaching basic Excel to people trying to improve their work life.
