Compass Call 
 
Seek an extraordinary life. 
A compass only points north, and with a simple compass you can adjust your course. You can get back on track. You can move in the direction you intend. You can seek adventure, and if you are lost for a while, you can find your way home.  Most days on a long adventure are ordinary. I want you to build ordinary days that lead to an extraordinary life. The compass is calling.

Who am I 
Why should you care to listen? Well, my name is Greg. I'm a husband, father, and professor. I'm even a friend to a few people. I love what I do. 
I teach at Creighton University full-time. But what's my job today? 
Today I'm not a professor. Today, I'm not your friend. What am I today? 
It is best described by a story. A sad story, from when I was in the Air Force.  If an accident occurred, the commander would have a down-day and discuss what went wrong to avoid doing it again. One day there was a plane like the one I flew in, a cargo plane. About four people were in this cockpit. A blinking light was going off, and it was serious. Now, they're highly trained. They know what to do. They got their checklist out, and they got to work. Heads down, working hard trying to figure out how to repair, how to fix, how to change what's going on. The sad part of this story is the plane ran into a mountain. No one was looking out the window. That's my job. I look out the window.  
By looking out the window, I guide people through a valley. I believe in a well scripted life. My definition of a well scripted life is a string of mainly ordinary days that lead to an extraordinary life. Start today from where you are with what you have. Get going. Write down some ideas as you read and put them into practice. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing ugly.i 
What is your job? 
I ask one thing. Right now, today, right here. Be where your feet are. Be present.   
Are you interested?
Maybe you don’t need to worry about a daily routine? Maybe you don’t walk around wondering if missing out or falling short? Maybe you don’t have a mild frustration that this isn’t the life you wanted to live? If you don’t have questions like these, I suggest you keep on doing what you are doing; however, if you do question, I wrote this for you.

The Promise 
I promise you if you work with me. You'll walk away with a plan. More importantly than a plan, you'll have the tools to adjust and get back on course. You have good ideas. And you get going, and it derails. As they like to say, the enemy gets a vote. The day gets out of control. Things happen. People call. Emails come in. You need to know how to get back on course.  

The Goal
You have the freedom to build the life you want. Life is a string of days. Like a baton in a relay race, you pass one day to the next; however, you only get to live one day at a time. What is a good day? Does a good day need good weather, plenty of food, lack of distractions, friends? While all those things might be on a list of a good days, they aren’t required to have a good day. When we are stressed, in trouble, or in danger, a day can be too long. A day is made up of hundreds of moments. A moment is a pause when you notice what is happening. The small space and moment you are living right then, right now. A good moment is when you aren’t rushed or afraid.  A good moment is when you realize you would be missed. I can be overwhelmed with the events and demands of a day, but I can catch a moment to notice that right now I am okay. I am alive. I have a chance. There is hope. Again, what is the goal? The goal is to build a day packed full of moments where you realize it is good to be alive. The odds are stacked against you, so you need a plan, a routine. 

Goal vs Life
Life is mor than goals. I start with goals, so you have some tactics to start building a life you want. Life is more important than goals. Life is what happens along the way.

First Draft. 
The secret to getting started is the first draft. Race to an ugly first draft and improve as you repeat each day. Live off the draft document of your ordinary day. You are never finished, but you must start. Including going to work, what does your typical day look like. Here’s an example to help you get started. This is only an example. You can start here, but edit heavily to make it your own: 
•	Rise and Shine. 6am 
•	Break Camp. 6 to 7am o What must happen before your day get going? 
§	Feed pets. 
§	Shower. 
§	Make your bed. 
§	Tidy up the kitchen. 
§	Make coffee.  
•	Pay Yourself First. 7am o Work on something that’s important to you personally.  
o	For me, I write. 
o	Maybe it’s art, side-gig, book, cooking, quilting, woodwork, exercise, etc... 
•	Launch others? 7:45 o Kids. 
o	Spouse. 
•	Check your schedule, not your email. 
•	Stand-up meeting o Maybe only with yourself. 
o	3 questions: 
§	What have you done? 
§	What are you going to do? 
§	Do you need any help? 
•	1st Work-Block. 8:30 to 10am o 75 to 90 minutes of focused work on one project. 
•	Break. 
o	Stretch your legs, refill coffee. 
o	Check email.  
•	2nd Work-Block. 10:30 to Noon o Based on feedback (email, phone calls, or just random 
thoughts), course correct if needed. 
o	Continue the first work-block if needed or select second 
MIT (most-important-thing). 
•	Reflection. Noon. 
o	Notice the blessings, surprises. 
o	What’s gone well today?  o What can you adjust for the afternoon? 
o	Gratitude. 
•	Break. 12:15 o Stretch your legs, refill coffee. o Check email. 
o	Eat if it is with others and benefits your quality of life; otherwise, wait if possible. This is highly productive time and energy. If you eat too early, it breaks your rhythm and steals your energy. Small snack if necessary until you get 
used to waiting. 
•	3rd Work-Block. 12:30 to 1:30pm o Again is 1st MIT done or as much progress as possible. 
o	Select 2nd MIT if required. 
•	Eat for Energy. 1:30pm o Eat what’s good for you.  
o	Eat less than stuffed.  
•	First Meeting-Block 2pm 
o	Try to hold open-ended, status update, or idea sessions for 
the afternoon if possible. 
•	Break 2:45 o Grab some water. (Or coffee if you must) o Visit with co-workers if it makes sense. 
o	Get outside if possible. 
•	Email session 3pm 
•	Open-Block 3:30 to 5pm 
o	Can be shorter if need to be. 
o	Group work, not analytical in nature. 
o	Meetings. 
o	Reading, prepping, planning, etc... 
•	Transition ritual. 5pm o How do you switch gears or hats or titles? Go from CEO to 
Mom? What does that look like for you?  
o	Call a friend on slow drive home?  o Stop at a park for 10 min and stare at the lake. o Read a poem. 
o	Listen to something funny. 
•	Evening Activities 5:30 o Kids to sports?  o Social events. 
•	Dinner on purpose 6pm/6:30? 
o	Don't grab drive-through unless planned for fun. 
o	Better to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if you are 
rushed than grab burger and fries. 
•	Setup Camp 7:30 o Clean up from the day: Kitchen, workspace, rooms. 
o	Pet care. 
o	Prep for tomorrow: clothes, food, check schedule. 
•	Begin to Rest. 9pm o No screens if you are a professional. o Read on paper. o Journal if you enjoy it. o Reflect on the day. 
o	Spend time with family, friends, spouse. 
•	Ready for bed. 
o	Rest is very important. You might tend to skip sleep to fit more into your day. This is a mistake. Better to run at full energy for a couple of hours less than live half-dead and produce poor quality decisions. Plus, you aren’t any fun to be around if you are always tired and working. 
What Should It Contain?  
Should is the wrong question. What does it contain now? You can draft an ideal, ordinary day if you like, but begin by writing down what’s happening now. I’m not asking you to audit your time. I’m saying to think through how you live your typical day. Once you know you’re your current days look like, start first with eliminating what’s not good for you? What doesn’t bring you a higher quality of life? Carve away the okay, the not-too-bad and have room to replace with I-love-it. 
Having said that, I believe the most important addition to your day is the concept of Pay Yourself First. You’ve heard the safety tip while waiting for your aircraft to take off, “Put your own oxygen mask on before helping others.” I was fortunate to be the test student in an altitude chamber training session while in the Air Force. We were pressurized to 35,000 feet, and I was asked to take off my mask. I had a child’s toy to work with during the experiment. I remember focusing on the toy. In about 15 seconds, I started to slow down. I figured it out, and everyone started to laugh. I didn’t know I had passed out until the instructor replaced my oxygen. With the oxygen back in place, I woke up and continued working. I had no idea that I could have died. No pain, no awareness at all. When the airline warns you to put your mask on first, you should listen. If you don’t take the time to Pay Yourself First, you will go through life as if you have passed out. You will operate, make money, raise kids, but it isn’t your agenda. You might regret having never tried. You won’t even know it until it’s too late. What do you want to encourage? What do you want to build, make, improve?  
The day isn’t a stream of even segments that are under your control. Much of our day is set for you based on choices you made before. What do you want to do before work, on the way to work, at work? What activities do you enjoy or find rewarding? What do believe sets you up for success? What can you focus on during a typical, ordinary day?  
Write out a few ideas now. Edit while reading this paper. Start where you are with what you have. Maybe you want to read for 15 minutes on a typical day? Maybe you call someone to check in and let them know they matter? Maybe you reflect on yesterday for 5 minutes? Write down the first draft. Make a template for your ordinary day. 
What is Typical. 
You're busy. You're a professional, you're working hard. I love the quote from Julius Irving, Dr. J. He says being a professional is doing the things you love to do on the days you don't feel like doing them. I think that's the definition of what you do. Some days you love it. Some days you don't. Doesn't matter, get to work. It's the work that matters.  
The work goes well for a while. You have a taste of success. You feel excitement in the air, but then as time goes on, you start to wonder how to do more, and it isn't that obvious. You suddenly realize you worked the last three weekends in a row. You missed a three-day trip with friends that you have scheduled every year. You start to think so, is this what burned out starts to feel like?  
No Right to Be a Lump on a Log 
It hit me hard when I was working at a car dealership. This was 30 years ago. I was the assistant manager for a service garage. People would bring in their cars for oil changes, rotating tires, that kind of thing. I would show up at 6:00 AM and get everything ready. I remember this one particularly cold day. The wind is blowing so hard the snow is horizontal to the ground. The cold is just ripping through me. I'm struggling to scrape snow off the car window so I can write the VIN number down to register the cars. All of this was before much technology, a lot of it was on paper. Suddenly, the parking lot lights go out. Time had changed, and we had not reset the automatic timer on the lights. Now I'm in the dark. Out of frustration and depression, I stopped. I stood there and thought, "Is this it; Is this what it's come to?” I realized I had to decide. This was a pivot point for me. Do I just become a lump on a log? Come to work. Do my job. Go home.  Come to work. Do my job. Go home. I realized 
no matter what I feel I don't have a right to be a lump on the log. Abraham Maslow, you know the hierarchy of needs guys, he said, “What you can be. You must be.” I don't think it was a motivational slogan. I think he's saying you don't have a choice. It's built into us to bring order to chaos. We're designed to create, to build, to make. To push forward, to get an agenda set. It's built into who you are. You don't have a right to be a lump on the log. Whatever you can be, you must be. If you can create a well scripted, ordinary day, you can lead an extraordinary life.  
Where to Start 
Where do you start? Did you scratch out a first draft for the ordinary day template yet? If not, take 3 minutes and write down a few ideas. Don’t worry about the complete list or the correct list. You need a signal that you have begun. You have started. Ready, fire, aim – and fire againii.  
Uneasy Footing. 
Why is it hard? Maybe you don’t feel like you are on solid ground? Abraham Maslow came up with this hierarchy of needsiii. 

	Actualization
	Esteem
	Love
	Safety
Physiological 

A key to take away from his work is that foundational needs must be satisfied before moving on to higher level needs. Not 100% fulfilled, but they must be satisfied before you can move up to the next level. For instance, the base need is physiological: Food, shelter, water. If you don't have a decent place to live or if you're parched for thirst, it's really hard to worry about safety. If you don't have safety, it's hard to worry about love, relationships. If you don't have love or relationships, it's hard to worry about esteem, and esteem is where you get your merit badges from school. Why worry about grades or a promotion at work if your home life is falling apart? Without esteem, you can't get to self-actualization, the highest level. You can't become who you must be. You need to work on relationships and friends. If you need therapy, get therapyiv. I did. It makes a big difference. It helps. Focus on your foundational needs, you're trying to get going. You're trying to set yourself up for success. 
Where do you go now? What's next?  
Three Pillars of Life. 
A well scripted life is built on three pillars:  
Direction 
Pace 
Rest 
Direction 
I went to Boston Harbor, and I got to walk on the USS Constitutionv. If you haven’t seen it, it’s an old sailing ship from the beginning of our country. It's still floating. It's still active in our Navy. Ceremonial, of course, but it's still there. And even that ship, the USS Constitution, has never left port without a destination. They don't just take it out and see where they want to go. I don't believe any ship ever leaves port without a destination. Unless something's horribly wrong. How many of us are going through life without a real destination, without a place that we're trying to go? The only way a ship can adjust course, set compass, know its heading is if it knows where it wants to end up. If you don't know where you want to be, you can drift, and you might not even notice.  
A good place to start is some journaling. Write for a bit about the life you want to live. What does that life look like, feel like? Who’s in it with you? What are you doing? Who are you? What are the trappings? What skill do you have? Have some fun describe the idea, decent life. Don’t turn it into a fantasy movie. Stay in the bounds of possibilities and stretch a bit. You might some clues of a near term direction. Don’t about lifelong pursuits yet. I’d focus on the next 3 monthsvi. 
Peter Drucker has five questions that I would encourage you to ask. He says to ask him about every six months: 
1.	What do you want to be remembered for? I think it's much more useful than a mission statement. What do you want to be 
remembered for? What is your legacy? 
2.	Who do you want to be remembered by? That's your client. It could be family. It could be friends. It could be students. Could 
be community. Most likely it's clients.  
3.	What do they find important? Not you. Them. What do they find 
important?  
4.	How are you going to measure that value? If you can measure it. 
You can work towards it.  
5.	What's your plan?  
These questions and the journaling will help set your course. You'll know where you're headed. You'll have a destination.  
Pace 
I have asked several people to describe a good, decent, average day. Two answers came back often: sense of accomplishment and a sense of peace. The peace was described as a lack of being rushed or the feeling of being late or behind schedule. Room in your schedule to have a slow, determined pace is the source of peace.  
When feeling rushed, you develop tunnel vision. You don’t have emotional room to think of others. You won’t see those in need. You don’t have the time to stop and help.  
The sense of urgency and speed is addictive. You can be addicted to the emotional state. Yon start to feel lazy or unproductive if you aren’t running at full speed, checking items off a list.  
If you truly are in a crisis, your brain will help you focus by shutting out non-essential information. The danger is that your brain isn’t good at deciding what’s essential, especially in the modern world. If you are truly in a crisis, you need to shut out distractions and seek safety; however, your artificial crisis, your sense of urgency, your hectic pace will shut out opportunities. Opportunities to help others and opportunities to help yourself.  
You won’t take the time to sit down and eat. You won’t slow down enough to help someone across the street. You won’t even think of going out of your way to be a good Samaritan. Have you bought into the idea 
of productivity? Are you measuring how many things you accomplish instead of what things you accomplish?  
Remember Wayne Gretsky's famous saying, “I skate where the puck is going to be.” The only thing I know about hockey is that it’s played on ice, but I have heard of the great Wayne Gretsky. I heard him in an interview talking about he wasn’t the greatest athlete or the fastest skater. His talent was being where he needed to be. Are you focused on being in the right place or are you focused on skating fast?  
Slow down. Do more of the important by doing less of everything else.  
Rest 
I heard an Olympic coach say getting the Olympians to work hard was easy. Getting them to rest was hard. The silence between the notes makes the music. The rest between the effort allows us to rebuild, reset and come back for a new day.  
Revert to the Mean 
I know a lot of us are sports fans. There's an idea in sports that gives me hope. A lot of people watching basketball mistakenly believe a player can be hot or cold. It’s called the hot hand. It turns out it's not true at all. It's just statistics. They can't hit them all. It averages out to their highest level of training. They put the effort in training, and they get rewarded on the court. There's no such thing as a hot hand. They revert to the mean, revert to the average, go back to the ordinary. That's the hope I'm banking on. There's no such thing as magic, a day where everything's clicking. Some days it works; some days it doesn't. It's just averages. It's just ordinary. I want you to count on averages.  I want you to put in the training, put in the ordinary, typical day that leads you where you want to go. Understand what the day can have. Understand what you want to put in the day. Learn how to say no to the things you don't want or don’t move you closer to where you want to be. Create a typical, ordinary day, not a special day, not a day to go to Disneyland, not a birthday. Those days will take care of themselves. I'm talking about just a typical, old Tuesday. What are you going to do?  
Will to Win 
One of the things you'll hear is that you have to have the will to win. There's a public speaker that I enjoy, he says, “You must want to succeed as much as you would want to breathe, if you were underwater.” It's a cute saying. You can want to win so bad it hurts, but your winning is determined by your training, by your practice. We were at a basketball game for a middle school team. It was a little tiny school gym, a lot of parents. At halftime, they had a fundraiser. You could buy a ticket early in the game if they called your name, you got a chance to shoot the basketball from half court. You get $50 if you make the shot. They announced this, and my 8-year-old son is beside himself with excitement. He begs for a couple of dollars, and we give it to him, and he goes down and buys tickets. They announce the winner. It's him. He has an entire quarter to think about it. He has won the drawing. He has spent this $50 four different ways, a NERF gun, candy, going to the movies. I mean, he has spent this $50 multiple times. He can taste it. It's real. You cannot want to win more than he did. His will to win was peaked. There was not an ounce of doubt in his body. He knew it was going to happen. Now there's one thing you should know. He's never played basketball in his life. He's not spent time on the court, and halfway is a long way. Half court's a long shot, even for a grown adult. For a kid about 8 years old, you might as well call it impossible. He walks down at halftime. The announcer is kind, man, he realizes what's going on. Everybody's trying to cheer him on. He launches it from half court. It barely makes it past the free throw line and bounces off to nothing. The announcer is nice. He says, “Hey, try again from the free throw line. If you make it, we'll still give you the money.” Now I'm thinking. “Maybe?” He walks up to the free throw line. He's serious. He shoots. He misses the rim completely. They feel bad for him. They suggest a layup for a free hot dog. He walks down and misses completely again. He got nothing. He scored exactly equal with his training. His will to win had no impact whatsoever. It's your will to practice that matters, and there's no such thing as a hot hand or a lucky day. You revert to the level of your training. You revert to the mean, to the average.  
The Ordinary Day 
What does the ordinary day hold for us? The day has 3 zones. 3 flavors, 3 phases. Call it whatever you want. I'm going to call it zones. 
Zone A 
Zone A is 7:00 AM to 1:00 PM. That first third of the day is where I'm all in. It's the highest energy, best time to approach puzzles, to be brave. 
By the way, the difference between a puzzle and a mystery? A mystery cannot be solved with more information. A puzzle can. The first part of the day is analytical brainpower. This is time to work on puzzles?  
Zone B 
You shift after lunch to zone B, about 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Zone B is more relaxed, more creative. This is the maker zone. This is when you're more open minded. This is a great time to work on mysteries, things that can't be solved with more information. This is creativity. This is the best place to have brainstorming sessions. You're going to be a little more relaxed, a little more open to hearing new ideas.  
Zone C 
The final zone, C,  is time to sleep. Time to rest, relax, recharge. This is time to hang out. This is time to get ready for the next day. This is from 8:00 PM to the morning. These times are not solid.  
They're not set in stone. For me it works. 
•	7am – 2pm: Zone A, Analytical. 
•	2pm -- 8pm: Zone B, Creative. The makerspace. 
•	8pm – 7am: zone C, Rest. Recharge, Sleep.  
You are Finite. 
There's not enough for you to go around, I'm afraid. You can't be everywhere all at once, all the time. Who gets the best of? You’re Agame. Who are you giving away your prime time to? Are you getting any of you at your best? Is your family, your loved ones? Make sure that you're spending your zone-A time in the way that you intend.  
What is in Your Day. 
What fills up your best part of the day? Allow me to use an old folk tale to make a point. Picture an old mining camp back in the 1849 gold rush. A few hundred people in a rough camp. Each weekend they would get together and bet on a dog race. A famous pair of dogs were owned by the same miner. Every time the owner knew which dog would win. Frustrated a competitor asked him for the secret. How did he know which dog would win? The owner told him that it was easy. He’d feed one and starve the other. You get the day you feed. 
When I sold car maintenance and repairs as a young man, I would struggle to get the right kind of work for appointments. The factory paid too little for repairs, so we sought after non-warranty repair work. I was so booked up with the low paying work that I didn’t have time to focus on the high paying work. My boss was much like the dog owner. He told me to book so much customer paying work that wouldn’t have time for the factory repair work. I got the mix of work I fed.  
Consider the type of day you want to feed. If you live a life right now that doesn’t have much room for your own agenda, it becomes even more important to be ready. Ready to do the few things you want to do when you get a chance. Pay yourself first. What are a few ideas to include? A few hints that I found from research that's highly 
recommended:  
•	Early sunshine. Get out there, look at the sun. Have a cup of coffee while looking towards the east. The sun wakes you up, 
turns on the brain.  
•	Exercise. You know, and don't do it. Start out easy. Walk the 
dog. Vacuum the floor. Act. Just get moving.  
•	Plan your eating. Don't just wait till you're hungry. Plan what you're going to eat. If not, you'll eat what's next to you, and what's next to you is probably junk. It's probably yellow, brown, or white. You need to eat food that doesn't come out of a plastic bag. I don't care what diet you're on, just do it on purpose. Have a 
plan where and what you're going to eat. 
•	Journal gratitude. This is a good time to put thoughts down about how good you have it. I know journalling is good to do, and I 
don't do it as I should. I have room to improve. 
•	Time with loved ones. I know it's zone A. It's analytical. It's time for puzzles. But who gets the best part of you? Maybe your wife, maybe your kids. I know you must work and make a living but, 
are you putting time in for others? Are you too worried to pause, too rushed to have time for others? That could be a problem. Remember the tortoise had a plan for race day. He didn't just show up and say, “Wonder what I'll do.”  
Principles 
Some is better than none. Now is better than later.  
Get started. Don't worry about the correct time. Just get started, have a decent breakfast, put your face in the sunlight, journal a little bit of gratitude, meditate or pray. And then adjust it.  
Reflection 
In between zone A and B, you should pause for a second, spend about 30 seconds to 5 minutes reflecting. Reflecting at noon gives you a chance to adjust your day. If you're off or on track, it gives you time to fine tune to, raise the bar. If you don't stop to reflect, you won't notice if you're off course until it's too late. After a tiny reflection for lunch, let's slide 
into Zone B. 
Shame of Delay Stalls the Beginning. 
Remember, the best time to plant a shade tree was 20 years ago? The next best time? Today. Don't allow the shame of delay to stall your start.  
Write It Down. 
Write out of an ordinary everyday routine, I would advise you to do it now. If you can get a piece of paper, scratch out the things you're going to do when you get up. For example, when I get up, it takes me two hours to get out of the house. I think of it as breaking camp. I spend 40 minutes working on a personal project that's important to me. I spend about 30 minutes feeding the pets, cleaning the kitchen, and getting ready. My shower is included in there. I get my stuff ready for work. Spend time free writing, not just writing for a purpose. All of the things that I like to do in the morning take about two hours, but since I know it takes 2 hours, I'm ready to go when I can get up. I know when I need set the alarm to make the day work. Also, I schedule in work blocks, roughly into 75 to 90 minute blocks of focused time, separated by breaks. The breaks are where I can work on tiny chores. Take care of things that are bugging me, whatever is necessary.  
Pay Yourself First.  
You know that when it comes to money paying yourself first is wise. I think you would agree that when it comes to time you forget about paying yourself first. Work a little bit on the project that matters to you.  
Not Going To Do List 
What are you not going to do? You talk about what we're going to do. What about what you are not going to do? You should keep a list. One of the tools I like is an e-mail service called Future Me (cost about 5 bucks a year). I write emails and put them out sometime in the future. They show up unexpected. One day I was out for a walk, and I got an e-mail from a year before. I'd forgotten all about it. From a year before the email comes in and says, “If you have not started learning Chinese by now, shut up and forget about it.” I still think about learning Chinese, but it’s not top of the list like it used to be. I'm not fooling myself as much as I used to. What are you not going to do? Write it down.  
Why Doesn’t Work Already 
Why doesn't it work? I haven't told you anything new. All this is old advice, simple, easy to follow. Why don't you follow it?  
Alarm Bells 
I have a theory that one of the problems is the alarm. Maybe you don't hear the alarm. Maybe the alarm is too dangerous to trip. You don't want what happens when you sound the alarm. When I was at Methodist Hospital, we had a virus spread throughout the hospital. This was in the early days of PC's. We were still struggling with how to update hundreds of machines quickly. We had to walk around with little disk, put them into each machine, let it run for a few minutes, and then go to the next machine. There were hundreds of PCs. We worked 30 hours straight. We kept thinking that we could get it under control, just a little bit longer. If we use a wildfire metaphor, the fire kept growing. Eventually, by the time we realized we needed to sound the alarm, the fire was out of control. It was too late to minimize the damage. A lot had gone wrong already. It would have been much better if we had sounded the alarm early, called people in. The problem was if you pull the alarm, big things happen. Higher management had to come in. They had to lock you in a conference room. They had to get everybody online. They really disrupted people's weekends. We were afraid to pull the big alarm because there were repercussions to pulling the alarm. We kept thinking we could do it ourselves. Sweep it under the table, take care of it before it gets big. We were wrong. I walked out of that with a lesson. You need a yellow alarm, not just a red alarm. There needs to be a lower-level alarm. Where you get other people's opinions to see if you're on the right track or not.  
Alarms are a good thing. Alarm bells are our friends. Alarm in the morning gets you out of bed, so you can get going. It's good. There are other kinds of alarms. There's resistance as an alarm. When I feel deep down that I don't want to move, I know that's what I need to do. I used to be in sales and I'd pull into a parking lot of my prospect. It was difficult to open the door. The door felt heavy and resisting. I knew that's the door I had to go through. And once the door was open, I was off to the races, no problem. Getting that door open was difficult. The resistance is a type of alarm. The bathroom scale is a type of alarm. An alarm goes in your mind when your weight is over a certain number. You start putting certain restraints in place, but you need restrictions early. If you adjust early, it is easier to get back on track. Don't wait till it's horrible, and you need a drastic plan. Ask for help early and often. Figure out what your alarms are, put them in place. Alarms should come 
in three levels: 
•	Red 
•	Yellow 
•	Green.  
At green, everything's fine. At yellow, you start to make some adjustments. If they can't correct in time, it turns red.  
DICE  
One of the alarms you can put in place for your projects, at work especially but at home too in your personal life, is DICE. The DICE model, the hard side of change management, is a Harvard Business Review article that I read years ago. The article gives you a rubric to 
grade yourself against your projects. It follows the anagram of DICE.  
•	D stands for duration. It's not talking about the length of the project; it's talking about how often you check in. What is the duration between check-ins? If it's more than a week, add penalty 
points. 
•	I is for integrity. Not whether you lie or tell the truth but integrity like a bridge can hold the weight. Does your team have 
the skills required to get it done? If not, add points.  
•	C2 is for commitment. Commitment from the top level and commitment from the front-line level. You need commitment 
from both. If you don't have it, add points.  
•	E is the last one and perhaps my favorite. It's effort. How much extra effort are you asking of yourself or your team? How much is 
reasonable to ask extra of?  
Say NO. 
Remember, we're looking at an ordinary day. We're talking about a long run. The slow and steady. There's no such thing as a hot hand. Everybody reverts to their training, they have no choice. The will to win doesn't matter. All of these things taken into account. Why can't you just do more? Certainly you can do more, but how much more? I usually ask my students, they say a typical semester is 16 hours. Why don't take eighteen? They could. They could take 21. Why not 24, 27, or 30? Obviously there's a place there where it breaks. It all comes falling down. The difficulty with adding more is that you don't just drop the last piece, you drop it all. This lesson was driven home with a biological study of an island a with limited reindeer capacity. I don't remember the exact numbers, but let me give you some directionally correct ideas. The island could sustain, let's say, 500 head of reindeer. The caretakers would manage the herd, cull out the weak, give them medicine. They manage the number to keep it around 500. They decided to let nature take its course and see what the island could do. Obviously, when the deer 501 came around, it didn't make any difference. 502 nobody saw anything as high as 600. They still were amazed that the island could take it. But then somewhere north of 600, they start to see signs of damage, overheating, sickness in the herd. It didn't drop down to 500. It crashed down to about 50. If you were juggling 3 balls, you're better than me. You could maybe even juggle 4 if I tossed one in. 5? Only a few people can do it, but there are people who can. If I toss in a 6th or 7th, you don't just drop one, you drop them all. The trick is deciding what you're not going to drop. Pick the balls you're going to juggle and don't take on anymore. Learn to say no. That's where effort is. How much extra effort can you do? Only about 10%. If you take on more than 10% extra effort, it is just an illusion. You're lying to yourself or your supervisor, or both.  If you can't say no, then you have no room to say yes. Look up the DICE model. It's a wonderful tool.  
Early Warning System 
Early warning systems are a superpower. Give me a heads up in time that I can do something about it. There are two types of early warning systems.  
Rapid Prototyping 
The first one is rapid prototyping. Plan. Do. Check.  Act: PDCA. We play a game in class called Spaghetti Tower. If you haven't seen this, it's a lot of fun. They get a marshmallow, 20 pieces of spaghetti, 3 feet of string, 3 feet of tape, and 18 minutes on the clock. Build the highest tower you can. Put the marshmallow on top. The problem is adults overthink it. They have a wonderful design. They're confident in their own knowledge. They start to work on the tower. Completely ignorant of how dumb they are, they have no idea what a spaghetti tower can or can't do. They've never done one before and they don't test the marshmallows weight till nearly the very end, and it's too late now to back up. No way to pick a different design. They're confident in the fact that they can build a tower, and they're wrong, very wrong. Turns out the Business School students are of the worst. I've done it over and over and over, and usually one team out of six or seven actually has a tower that even stands. The first early warning system is to test early and test often. Put the marshmallow on the spaghetti, see how it works. Adjust from what you learned. Do it again.  
Reflection 
The second early warning system is reflection. I mentioned it earlier. Reflection has been around for a long time. St. Ignatius was teaching reflection 500 years ago. It wasn't new to him. The best plan is to stop for a minute or two at noon. Before lunch pause and check in with yourself. Are you on track? Are you having fun? Is life the way you want it? If not, now is the time to change.  
Find Your Strengths 
Drive the Truck. 
When I was about 10 years old, we had a small hobby farm in Kentucky. One of my chores required me to drive the truck through a gate into the barn yard. Directly ahead of the gate was a pond. I was afraid of driving into the water, and I had to take a hard left after the gate. I’m slowly pulling forward as I look out the driver’s door window and see the fence post getting closer and closer. I inch forward hoping there’s room. What I didn’t notice was a railroad spike sticking out about 6 inches. The spike was there to keep the gate from swinging all the way through when closed. The spike caught the bed of the truck. The side of the truck caved in from the pressure of the spike.  
My Dad worked harder than any man I have ever met, but he was not kind. I was terrified of him finding out, and he wouldn’t be home for a few hours yet. When he finally got home and found out, he told me, “Drive the truck. Don’t let the truck drive you.” A lesson that has stuck with me for life. Drive the truck has become a metaphor for performance at work. Drive the project. Don’t let the project drive you. Drive the quarter. Drive the relationship. Drive the team. In a word, lead. 
Be a Pig. 
As a small boy on the farm, I had the duty of watching the animals. Occasionally, I had to put up a temporary electric fence to keep the animals on one side of the barn yard while work was done on the other. I would experiment with turning the fence on and off. Only a thin wire separated the animals from freedom. The cows would touch the wire once and never test it again. I could turn the fence off, and they would stay put. Pigs were different. The pig’s nose is very tender and sensitive. A pig would smell the wire. Get very close to the wire without touching it. The pig could sense if the wire was on or off. If the wire was off, they would walk right through. Don’t be a cow. Be a truck-driving pig. 
Call Your Shots. 
Are you living on luck? What are you good at? What are your strengths? You don’t need a survey to discover your strengths. You need a feedback loop. You need a rearview mirror. Call your shots. Write down each week what you intend to do for the week. Did you accomplish what you intended to accomplish? If you don't call your own shots, you will rewrite history, adjust your expectations, and excuse the lack of progress. Don't tell me what you're going to do. Tell me what you've done. Take a look at the list. Did you get it done or not? It's not a critique, it's a conversation. If you didn't get it done, why not. Look in the mirror, have an honest conversation. Figure out why it didn't get done? Is this something you can't do, or something you won't do? If it's a can't do it, get the skills. If it's a won’t do, change the game. Maybe you need a new line of work? 
Daily Tactics 
Spend time on what's important to you. Pay yourself first. What's the important thing for you? Should you prepare or should you act? May depend on the where you're at in your season of life or your job.  
Traps to Avoid 
Don't sit down and just work through e-mail. You want to lead, not operate your machinery, your plan, your life. You want to lead the day. You lead the day by making a choice, having a direction and setting off in that direction with purpose. Work one thing at a time. I like to open up OneNote. I have a document called “start here”. Inside that document I have a few things that I can't forget. I have a reminder about having gratitude and saying thank you. That's where I start every day. I set Outlook to open the calendar, not e-mail. 
Defense Against Email 
If you can, delete the e-mail. If you can’t delete the e-mail, respond to it if it takes less than two minutes. I got this from David Allen, GTD. I think it's amazing. If it's going to take more than two minutes, and you can't delete it, then you got to schedule it. Don’t put it on a To-Do list. 
The To-Do list is the same thing as a wish list. Doesn't mean anything. It's your time that matters. When are you going to work on this scheduled task? You'll find out that it's hard to find time. You'll think you're too busy. Well, then, at least you can tell people you're busy and why. E-mail is a trap. If you want less e-mail, don't send e-mail. Get up. Go see somebody call, text, SMS, social media, anything but e-mail. Again, you don't want to operate. You don't want to be good at spinning your wheels. You want to lead, do less, and get somewhere. If you aren’t careful, you’ll sit down to work. Won’t look up till lunch. That's a danger. If e-mail leads your day, you’ll get pulled on the current of the urgent. If you don't know what's important to you, you'll get pulled into other people's dramas, other people's goals.  
When in Doubt 
When in doubt, work on tomorrow. What can you do today to get ready for tomorrow? That's a double payback, one: it feels worthwhile today. And two: when tomorrow rolls around, you'll have more time to work on the next day.  
Typical Tuesday 
You are trying to build a typical Tuesday, an ordinary Tuesday. A typical Tuesday that keeps you on course headed towards your destination. A typical Tuesday that becomes your average. The routine you return to when you get tired. Your plan is always a draft. Adjust it. Make it your own and leave room for fun. Do it your way. Enjoy a Well Scripted Life.  
Are You Doing You?
Let’s assume you are doing the work to build a good daily routine. Is the routine you are building the right routine for you? What about your purpose or your passion? Working on your passion is typically a rear-view mirror answer. You’ll know it when you look back with gratitude. More important question is what are you doing? The question “Who am I?” is a different way of saying “What do I do?” Who you are and what you do are the same thing.
If you are a writer, you write. If you are a parent, you have children. If you are honest, you tell the truth. Don’t isolate the being from the doing. Don’t say I want to lose weight or be thin. Act like a thin person. Do what a thin person does. Don’t wish to be or have something. Figure out the activities done by a similar person and do those things. L
Zig Ziglar said, “What you do speaks so loud, I cannot hear what you say.”  I love to hear what you’ve done. I don’t care much to discuss your plans. Ideas are easy. Execution is hard. Show me your bank statement and your schedule, and I can tell you what’s important in your life. Decide what you want to do and do it on purpose. Lead your life with action, not personal mission statements. Living a life can be a struggle. Fight to do the things you find enjoying and rewarding.

Mirrors
Life is a game of mirrors. Life reflects back to you the energy, mood, and meaning you project. Like the song tells us, “If you want love, then you’ll have to give love.” NF.  
I learned this principle slowly. The lesson started on a hike in the Black Hills of South Dakota. My son was only 8 years old, and we were going through a rough patch. I was always mad at him, and he started talking back and running to Mom whenever he was corrected. The situation had escalated to a point where my anger and disappointed were alarming. I remember thinking I would accept a life without a father-son relationship. 
My wife wasn’t having it. Thankfully, she corned me and told me to stop acting this way or get out. She had seen enough. Our children deserved better. She was right; of course. I had something thinking to do.  

Summary 
1)	What do you want to be remembered for.  
2)	Where are you headed?  
3)	Call your shots and review the results each week.  
4)	Pay yourself first. 
5)	Be where your feet are. 
6)	You're being scored and how you treat others.  
7)	Reflect and correct. 
Finally, one of my favorite verses: 
“I can think of nothing better than to eat, drink, and enjoy your toil.”  
You are going to toil. You are going to work, to fight. My dream for you is that you'll find your fight rewarding and perhaps enjoyable. “Go, Set the world on fire.” St. Ignatius
